# ⏱️ Stopwatch App

The **Stopwatch App** is a simple and responsive web-based stopwatch built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It provides the basic stopwatch functionalities including **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset**. The application features a clean and minimal design, with a large digital timer display that updates every second. The layout is fully centered on the screen, making it user-friendly across different devices. The background and button colors are styled for a modern look, and the buttons are interactive with hover effects. The logic is implemented using JavaScript with `setInterval` for timer control and simple condition checks for time formatting (HH:MM:SS). This project is ideal for beginners learning JavaScript DOM manipulation and timing functions.
